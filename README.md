# San Francisco Real Estate Investment

A company is pursuing a real estate investment project in the San Franciso area. The strategy is to buy rental properties with cash flow. To determine which neighborhoods would be most profitable, housing data of price per square foot, housing units, and average rental rates have been collected from previous years. The data will be prepared in a Jupyter Notebook using tools from the Pandas and HvPlot libraries. The goal is to discover which neighborhoods show the highest trends in rental rates, compared to the purchase price per square foot.
